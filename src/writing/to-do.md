## Who puts a to do list publicly on their website

This post functions as a **to do list for the development of this website**. By following the [**Learn Eleventy From Scratch**](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) course by [Andy Bell](https://hankchizljaw.com/), I built this beauty of a website.

The site uses the static site generator **[Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)** (11ty) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

This list is supposed to motivate me to not let the development sleep, but actually improve the site and the site's experience for all of you!

## So what will happen here next

- ~~Learn Eleventy From Scratch~~
- ~~Customize the design~~
- ~~Customize the structure of the website and each single page~~
- ~~Create a photography project~~
- ~~Start a to do list~~
- ~~Exclude drafts from blog posts~~
- Build a gallery to house my photos. _They live on an Adobe Portfolio right now,_ but this is neither beautiful nor does it perform well enough for me (or the lighthouse scores, for that matter)
- Convert past projects to markdown format and get them online
- Convert past blog posts, so that their format fits the requirements of the new website
- **Create more**â€”more text, more designs, more websites, more photos
- ...
