## Why would I use a password manager

Ask yourself, why you **wouldn't** use one. The answer to this question could for example be

- I have all my passwords **rememberd** or
- I **write them down** on paper.

If you answered, you remember all your passwords, you either have incredible memory, extremely weak passwords, or very few strong passwords.

If you write your passwords down, you are in for a very hard time, if you lose that piece of paper. And if this single source of truth becomes lost or stolen, you can only hope for very nice people to find it and bring it back to you without having read it all before.

A password manager gives you **secure storage** to save login data, important documents, secret notes, and more. All those items, stored in the password manager, **cannot be accessed by anyone but you**. Since you can easily sync your password manager to multiple devices—if you use a cloud solution—or you can simply copy over your password storage to other devices—if you want to stay away from the cloud—you **have your passwords always with you**.

Storing your passwords in a password manager, gives you the possibility to **use extremely strong passwords**, and even **unique passwords** for every single tool or website, you use. This way, even if someone would get access to a password you used—e.g. in a data breach—only a single service will be affected and the login data to that service can be easily changed.
