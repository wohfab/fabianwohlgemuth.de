## Why would I use a password manager

Ask yourself, why you **wouldn't** use one. The answer to this question could for example be

- I have all my passwords **rememberd** or
- I **write them down** on paper.

If you answered, you remember all your passwords, you either have incredible memory, extremely weak passwords, or very few strong passwords.

If you write your passwords down, you are in for a very hard time, if you lose that piece of paper. And if this single source of truth becomes lost or stolen, you can only hope for very nice people to find it and bring it back to you without having read it all before.
