## Software

### Security

Software I use every day, to keep me and my data save. **A password manager is the one piece of software, everyone must have**. My software of choice is [1Password](https://1password.com/). Within 1Password, I can securely store passwords, sensitive notes, credit card information, passport & ID, and important files like my digital signature. For VPN, I use [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/).

### Notes & Documentation

I do document a lot. Most of my *personal knowledegebase* resides within [Notion](https://www.notion.so). I use it also as a link saver with the [Notion web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper). For notes on my tablet, I use [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/).

### Storage

For storage I mainly use [G Suite's Google Drive](https://goo.gl/VDDB1X). With the business account, I can get unlimited storage. For secure business storage, I use a self hosted [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance. This way I can password protect file shares for my customers.

### Code

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my main editor. The settings I use can be found on [my settings gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/wohfab/9c0e41c05f54b13e6c5acfc3ffeec2b4). To use the settings, you will need the extension [Settings Sync (shan.code-settings-sync)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync).

When on the Terminal ([iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [Termius](https://termius.com/)), I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) for *window management* and [vim](https://www.vim.org/) as my main editor.

### Design

I mainly use the [Affinity by Serif Suite](https://affinity.serif.com). Affinity Photo for photo editing, Affinity Designer for vector graphics / Illustrations, and Affinity Publisher for layout and desktop publishing work. Someimtes, I fall back to the Adobe Creative Cloud; but usually only for [Adobe Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/).

## Hardware

I use a 2019 15" MacBook Pro with a 2,3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16GB RAM. Sometimes, the 2018 iPad Pro 11" gets added via sidecar. When on the road, paired with Apple Pencil 2 and Smart Folio Keyboard, the iPad turns into my main device. Always by my side, is an [A5 LEUCHTTURM1917 dotted notebook](https://amzn.to/3dN2jRK). I use the Nextstand laptop stand, the [small Apple Magic Keyboard](https://amzn.to/30jSdnF), and the [Logitech MX Master 3 mouse](https://amzn.to/2XHX3ta). My phone of choice is a [OnePlus 7 Pro](https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-7pro).

When not using Netlify & Netlify CMS, I use [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/cd4a2286dea7) for setting up servers and [Moss SH - Virtual Sysadmin](https://moss.sh/?ref=0f29969959d0) to make administration easier in the long run.
