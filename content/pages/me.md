My name is Fabian Wohlgemuth. I live in the northern part of North-Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. I studied Linguistics & Texttechnology and Computational Linguistics at Bielefeld University, Germany and Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.

Besides my fascination for brilliantly thought through User Experience Design, I concentrate myself on continuous self-improvement and let digitalization help me with that.
